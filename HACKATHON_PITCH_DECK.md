## 📑 Slide 2: The Problem 💡
### Modern Knowledge Workers Are Drowning in Documents

**The Pain Points:**
- 📂 **File Chaos**: 1000s of PDFs, images, docs scattered everywhere
- 🔍 **Search Failure**: Traditional file search only finds filenames, not content
- 🖼️ **Image Blindness**: Text in images/scanned PDFs is invisible to search
- ⏰ **Time Drain**: Spend hours hunting for information you KNOW exists
- 🤯 **Context Loss**: Found the file, but what's the key insight?

**Why It Matters:**
- Knowledge workers waste 20% of time searching for information
- Critical insights trapped in unindexed images and documents
- $12,000+ per employee annual cost of information inefficiency
