1. Clear search and type "project risks"
2. Show instant results from multiple file types
3. Demonstrate search speed with timing

**Narration:**
*"Now let's search for 'project risks'. I'm not looking for files named 'project risks' - I want to find any document that discusses project risks, even if it uses different words..."*

**Show on Screen:**
- Search results appearing in real-time
- Results from PDF documents AND extracted from images
- Timing indicator: "Search completed in 50ms ⚡"
- Highlight relevant text snippets

**Key Message:** *"See how it found relevant content in both regular documents AND extracted text from that handwritten meeting notes image. And it's lightning fast - 50 milliseconds!"*

### 🤖 Part 4: AI-Powered Insights (60 seconds)

**Action:**
1. Open AI Q&A interface
2. Ask: "What are the main project risks mentioned across all documents?"
3. Show AI processing and response

**Narration:**
*"Now for the AI magic. Instead of reading through dozens of documents, let me just ask: 'What are the main project risks mentioned?'"*

**Show on Screen:**
- AI processing indicator
- Contextual answer with sources
- References to specific documents including the handwritten notes

**Key Message:** *"The AI has analyzed across ALL our documents - including that handwritten text we just uploaded - and given us a comprehensive answer with sources. This is turning documents into actionable insights."*

## 🎛️ Demo Setup Checklist

### Pre-Demo Preparation:
- [ ] **Test Environment**: Ensure all services running (Worker, Backend, Frontend)
- [ ] **Sample Documents**: Prepare folder with 10-15 mixed files
- [ ] **Handwritten Notes**: Have physical notes ready for live OCR demo
- [ ] **Performance**: Clear cache to show both first-search and cached speeds
- [ ] **Backup Plan**: Have screenshots/video backup if live demo fails

### Technical Setup:
- [ ] **Screen Resolution**: Set to projector-friendly resolution
- [ ] **Font Sizes**: Increase terminal/console fonts for visibility
- [ ] **Browser Zoom**: Increase to 150% for better visibility
- [ ] **Audio**: Test microphone levels
- [ ] **Timing**: Practice to stay within 3-4 minutes

### Demonstration Files:
```

## 🎤 Speaking Tips

### Engagement:
- **Start with Pain**: "How many of you spent time last week hunting for a document?"
- **Use "We" Language**: "Let's see what happens when we search..."
- **Highlight Innovation**: "This is the first solution that combines..."

### Technical Confidence:
- **Explain While Doing**: Narrate each action
- **Handle Delays**: "While this processes, note that it's actually reading the handwritten text..."
- **Show Status**: Point out the visual indicators

### Recovery Lines (if something breaks):
- **Slow Processing**: "This normally takes 2 seconds, but with the projector lag..."
- **Connection Issues**: "The beauty of our system is it works offline too..."
- **Demo Failure**: "Let me show you the results we prepared earlier..."
